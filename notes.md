Explanation of the Columns:
- id: An auto-incrementing integer that serves as the primary key for the table.
- email: A unique email address for each user, used for login. This field is set to be unique to prevent duplicate entries.
- password: A hashed password for authentication purposes.
- full_name: The full name of the user.
- user_type: An ENUM field that specifies the type of user. It can be either 'employer' or 'intern'.

Additional Recommendations:
- Password Hashing: Ensure that when you store passwords in the password field, they are securely hashed using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
- Indexes: The email field is unique, which implicitly creates an index on it. If you need to frequently search by other fields (e.g., full_name), consider adding indexes to those fields as well.
- Constraints: The NOT NULL constraint ensures that none of the fields can be left empty when a new user is created.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might insert a user into this table:

INSERT INTO users (email, password, full_name, user_type)
VALUES ('user@example.com', 'hashed_password_here', 'John Doe', 'intern');
Make sure to replace 'hashed_password_here' with the actual hashed password.

This setup will provide a solid foundation for managing users in your application.
